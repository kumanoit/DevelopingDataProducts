# Coursera : Developing Data Products
This project belongs to developing data products course which is one of the courses from Data Science Specialization.

This is a simple prediction algorithm which makes a linear regression model on height and body masss of ten different people.
On the basis of this model we can make a prediction of height of the person on the basis of its body mass.

##INPUT
There are three fields. 

  1) First one asks for the name of the person. 
  
  2) Second, takes age as an input.
  
  3)  In third field body mass of person is to entered
  
## OUTPUT
  1)  Name and age is shown as output as it is.
  
  2)  To calculate height of the person on the basis of given body mass, a linear regression model is created for data collected for 10 persons.
